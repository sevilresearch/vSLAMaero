# UAV_Entropy

Two pycharm projects exist within this repository: AirSimWorking and EntropyRewrite.
	AirSimWorking is a project that contains Luke Fina's version of the UAV Entropy code.
	EntropyRewrite is Jason Carnahan's rewritten version of the code using standard OOP techniques.

The Folder `Papers` contains other documents helpful for the project
